## About EKI

EKI was born from a desire to make high tech kink applications more accessible. 
By open sourcing the development we do, we aim to make experimentation both easier and safer.

You have probably heard about some of the many sex toys that turned out to be insecure, unsafe, or leaking information. 
We hope to inspire the industry to move into a new direction, putting the user in charge of their most personal data, making sex toys a worthwhile investment.

## Projects

### Security

Our mission for safer kink doesn't end with our own projects. We are also happy to help others improve.

As of **2023-6-17** we have found **1 high severity** and **1 critical severity** vulnerabilities in a total of **1** product.

There are products that we think would benefit from security research, but that we do not have the resources to obtain. We are currently actively looking for the following:

- Fancysteel .apk file

If you can help, contact us at hello (AT) embeddedkink (DOT) com. Response may at times be delayed.

### Lockbox

The main project at the time of writing is the digital [Lockbox](./lockbox.md). 
Chastity enthusiasts engaging in solo or long distance play will often put keys in a lockbox, take a photo of the combination without looking and send the photo to a website or other person. 
This is error prone and quite a hassle. 
Digital and bluetooth-enabled devices exist but these tend to be very low quality or very expensive.

With the EKI Lockbox, it takes no effort to lock up. 
The password you lock the box with can then be sent to an online keyholding site (like [Emlalock](https://emlalock.com/) or [Chaster](https://chaster.app/)) or sent to a friend and then deleted on your own side.

The design is available to use freely under GPL v3 but units will also be available pre-assembled in our store.

### Chastity devices

We maintain a fork of [Space Buck's](https://github.com/heyspacebuck) parametric chastity cage [here](https://github.com/embeddedkink/parametric-chastity-cage). Our goal is to add small improvements for easier printing. While it is a good cage, this project will make way for a belt soon.

Printable chastity belts are less commonplace than printable chastity cages. Some experimentation has been done at the EKI headquarters but version 0.1 is still far away.
