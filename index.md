## About EKI

EKI was born from a desire to make high tech kink applications more accessible. By open sourcing the development we do, we aim to make experimentation both easier and safer.

There are plenty of horror stories about insecure applications and data leaks. We hope to inspire the industry to move into a new direction, putting the user in charge of their most personal data, making sex toys a worthwhile investment.

## Projects

The main project at the time of writing is the digital [Lockbox](https://github.com/embeddedkink/lockbox). Chastity enthusiasts engaging in solo or long distance play will often put keys in a lockbox, take a photo of the combination without looking and send the photo to a website or other person. This is error prone and quite a hassle. Digital and bluetooth-enabled devices exist but these tend to be very low quality or very expensive.

With the EKI Lockbox, it is easy to generate a new password (key), lock the box from behind your keyboard and upload the key somewhere safe. The box can be made very cheaply and is very secure, being tamper evident. The design is available to use freely under GPL v3 but units will also be available pre-assembled in our store.
