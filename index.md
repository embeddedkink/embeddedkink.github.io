## About EKI

EKI was born from a desire to make high tech kink applications better for the user.

You have probably heard about some of the many smart sex toys that turned out to be insecure, unsafe, or leaking information. 
We hope to inspire the industry to move into a new direction, putting the user in charge of their most personal data and making sex toys a worthwhile investment.

## Projects

### Security

Our mission for safer kink doesn't end with our own projects. When we come across insecure products, we try to disclose the vulnerabilities in a responsible manner. 

So far, we have found medium, high and critical vulnerabilities in 5 different products, impacting tens of thousands users.

### Lockbox

The main project at the time of writing is the digital [Lockbox](./lockbox.md). 
Chastity enthusiasts engaging in solo or long distance play will often put keys in a lockbox, take a photo of the combination without looking and send the photo to a website or other person. 
This is error prone and quite a hassle. 
Digital and bluetooth-enabled devices exist but these tend to be very low quality or very expensive.

With the EKI Lockbox, it takes no effort to lock up. 
The password you lock the box with can then be sent to an online keyholding site (like [Emlalock](https://emlalock.com/) or [Chaster](https://chaster.app/)) or sent to a friend and then deleted on your own side.

The design is available to use freely under GPL v3 but units will also be available pre-assembled in our store.

### Citadel

Citadel is a project that consists of an API and a webapp. It is not yet published. We do not expect to have the resources to host an instance in the forseeable future.

The main purpose of Citadel is to have a user to complete different tasks as part of a bondage scene. The first of these actions will only include scanning a tag that is bound to a certain location, but we hope to extend the system with infrared sensors, connectors to video games, and more.

The user will be able to design a state machine to allow for very flexible scenes. An example scene is as follows. If you stay in a room, you will get the key after 4 hours. If you leave the room, you will get the key after 8 hours. If you go to a specific location outside, and within 30 minutes you visit a different set location, you get the key instantly.

### Chastity devices

We maintained a fork of [Space Buck's](https://github.com/heyspacebuck) parametric chastity cage [here](https://github.com/embeddedkink/parametric-chastity-cage). Work on this project has stagnated for the time being.
